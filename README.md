# React Chatbot

This Next.js is boilerplate for integrating a [Botpress](https://botpress.com/) bot into React using [pre-built React Components](https://botpress.com/docs/webchat/webchat-components/component-library/fab).
You can watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4je2_HMCXU0) where I built this.

## Setup

Run:

```sh
npm i
```

Create a `.env.local` file and add:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_BOT_CLIENT_ID
```

Where `YOUR_BOT_CLIENT_ID` is your bot's client ID. More details [here](https://botpress.com/docs/webchat/webchat-components/get-started#:~:text=Obtain%20your%20Client%20ID).

## Next.js Boilerplate

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
